# WordleAppClone
### Project Description
This is a Wordle game clone I built with the help of Ania Kub√≥w from YouTube. It is really great to see women in the technology industry and to be able to learn from them. As a new developer, I have found coding alongside an experienced developer as a way to gain productive time on the keyboard and really see how much you can do with code. This application uses basic web fundamentals: JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It was important for me to know how to build a front end application with the basics before I moved onto learning frameworks like React or Angular, I also think that the better my fundamental knowledge the more I can do with a framework. The backend is run with Node.js because it works seamlessly with the JavaScript on the front end, its fast and does not require lengthy coding. 

### Tools and Technologies: 
- JavaScript 
- CSS and HTML
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios 

### Development Approach 
- rgergergreger

# WordleAppClone
JS/HTML/CSS with Node Server 
This is a Wordle game clone I built with the help of Ania Kub√≥w from youtube. It is really great to see women in the technology industry and to be able to learn from them. This application uses basic web fundamentals: JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It was important for me to know how to build a front end application with the basics before I moved onto learning frameworks like React or Angular, I also think that the better my fundamental knowledge the more I can do with a framework. The backend is run with Node.js because it works seamlessly with the JavaScript on the front end, its fast and does not require lengthy coding.
